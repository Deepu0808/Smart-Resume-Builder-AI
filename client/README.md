## 🏗️ System Architecture  
The system follows a three-tier architecture:  
1. **Frontend (React.js)** – Handles UI rendering and form data validation.  
2. **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)** – Processes user inputs and communicates with the AI model.  
3. **Database (MongoDB)** – Stores user profiles and generated resumes.
